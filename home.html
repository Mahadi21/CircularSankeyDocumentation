                <span style="color: green; font-size: 20px; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">A</span> large amount of statistical data on flows and stocks of energy, material, and capital in different industrial 
                processes is available. Statistical information is abstract. These abstract data are very comprehensive and complex and  therefore, they are presented in aggregated form to decision makers. 
                This aggregation allows them to answer central questions on a countrys  metabolism like: How much of the total energy consumed goes into mining/making materials/transport? or How material 
                and energy intensive is the service sector of this country?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Often these abstract data are found too complex to understand. Therefore, a good and flexible way of visualizing this abstract data is important. To visualize these data effectively, 
                following some specific design principles are essential that are derived from an understanding of human perception. Here comes the idea of Data Visualization.

                <span style="color: green; font-size: 20px; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Data Visualization</span> is a way of representing abstract data (machine readable) into human readable form. 
                The target of this visualization is to enable the decision makers to see data visually, so that they can grasp difficult concepts easily.  Data visualization is a fast and easy way 
                to present concepts and you can Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
                <br>
                <br>
                A new concept to visualize these abstract data could be based on the widely used <span style="color: green; font-size: 16px; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Sankey diagram</span>. A Sankey diagram is a type of flow diagram where the flow is represented by arrows of varying 
                thickness depending on the quantity of flow. They are often used to visualize energy, material or any other industrial or business flow and are especially useful in demonstrating 
                proportionality to a flow where different parts of the diagram represent different quantities in a system.

                <br>
                
                The core of the work is to develop an open source piece of software that converts a well-defined dataset (specified as .csv) into a scalable vector graphic (.svg) using one of several pre-defined possible structures of
                the diagram (specified as .xml). The idea is to start with the Sankey method of D3.js and extend it to a rich tool that can be used by researchers in the field
                of environmental systems analysis in the years to come.
